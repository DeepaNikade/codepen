## Introduction
This project aims to replicate the functionality of CodePen.io, a popular online code editor and front-end development environment, using React. By following this guide, you'll learn how to set up a basic version of CodePen.io where users can write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in separate panels and see the live output.

Run the Development Server: Start the development server to see your React app in action:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Clean Up Default Files: Delete the default files (App.css, App.test.js, logo.svg, index.css) inside the src directory.

## Project Structure
